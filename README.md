:heavy_exclamation_mark:NOTE: If both characters are both equal power, BOTH are eliminated. 

### Movement
1. Heroes always make the first move. Players move alternately. 
2. A player is allowed to move only one piece at a time.
3. A move consists of moving a piece to a square, either forward, backward or sideward. A diagonal move or a move of more than one square is illegal. 

### Battle
As the game progresses, battles are made resulting in the elimination of marvel characters. A "battle" is made when a character moves into the same square occupied by an opposing character. When a battle occurs the following rules of elimination apply:

1. A higher powered character eliminates a lower powered character from the board 
2. If both characters power level are of equal, both are eliminated.
3. Loki(Heroes) / Hela(Villain) eliminates any character with a power level of 12 down to a character with a power level of 1
4. The Nexus can be eliminated by any piece.
5. Only Shield Agents (Heroes) and Hydra Soldiers (Villains) can eliminate the infiltrator (Loki/Hela). 

### HOW THE GAME ENDS
The game ends:
1. When the Nexus is eliminated
2. When a player resigns.
3. When both players agree on a draw
